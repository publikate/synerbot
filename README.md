## Synerbot

This is a relatively simple IRC bot designed soully for the purpose
of connecting to an IRC channel, and doing whatever I say. I will work
on updating it, sort of slowly, but surely.

##### English Update

Synerbot is out to learn English.  Wait, I thought synerbot spoke English
already! Well, that's true, Synerbot does have preprogrammed English phrases
in it's code, however, Synerbot will actually be able to form it's own English
sentences. Please do laugh at the silly sentences Synerbot comes up with.

##### Building

Just type `make` in the terminal. Makefile will take care of the rest

##### Debugging

All bug reports go to Synergiance.
